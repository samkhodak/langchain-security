# LangChain Security Exercises

This repo stores all of the exercises I completed in learning LangChain features and creating security-based LLM chains and agents.

## Setup

Each folder contains a self-contained program that can be set up by running the following commands within each directory:

```
virtualenv -p python3 env 
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

After installing, run each file with python:

``` python3 app.py```
